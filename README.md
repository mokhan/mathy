# Mathy

I wrote mathy during my daughters saturday morning dance class. It
started off as a conversation something like this...

```text

Dad: Isn't your class supposed to start by now?

Daughter: Miss Brittney's not here yet.

Dad: Your teacher's late again? Ugh... 

Dad: ...grumble, grumble, grumble...

Dad: Well what do you want to do?

Daughter: Ummm.... can I have some gum?

Dad: No! 

Daughter: Please?

Dad: No.

Daughter: Can we do kids ruby?

Dad: That's a good idea. Let me grab my laptop.... 

Dad: Oh right. I re-installed the OS. I need to re-download kids ruby.

Daughter: Huh?

Dad: Umm... let's do some math.

Daughter: ok.

Dad: I have an idea, let's build a math game.

Daughter: Ummm... ok.

Dad: What should it do when it starts?

Daughter: Huh?

Dad: How about it asks you for your name?

Daughter: Ok...

...hack on some code, hack on some code

Daughter: Miss Brittney's here. Bye!

...hack on some code, hack on some code
...hack on some code, hack on some code
...hack on some code, hack on some code

```

Then this turned into the thing we would play with before dance class.
Then during class while I sat out in the hall, I kept hacking on this
mathy thing. Yup... not tests... pure hacking!
